=========  
=GENERAL=
=========

NOTICE: This addon is in very early stages of development. Most planned features are not yet implemented.
        Please keep this in mind when using this addon.

This addon adds a leveling system to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly. Currently it is very rudimentary; however, I plan to make
it much more in-depth in the coming months.

In its current state, when the player kills NPCs or mutants in the Zone they gain experience points. After gaining a
certain amount of these points the player will level-up, increasing their stats. 

The exact details can be found in:

    \gamedata\configs\levelmod\level_system.ltx




==================
=PLANNED FEATURES=
==================

    NOTICE: All planned features are subject to change or cancellation at my sole discretion. Timeframes given are 
    ROUGH estimates of when I hope to have these features added in some form. These estimates may be completely wrong.

    ============================
    =NEAR FUTURE (1 - 3 months)=
    ============================

    1. Experience points from kills are based on the relative difficulty of entity killed.
        e.g. A Chimera will grant much more experience than a Flesh.
    2. Experience point loss on death. (Optional)
    3. A placeholder UI for the mod.

    ===============================
    =FURTHER ALONG (6 - 12 months)=
    ===============================

    1. A sleek but functional UI for the mod.

    2. SKILL BASED EXPERIENCE SYSTEM

        This is the major milestone I will be moving towards.  A seperate experience pool for skills ala Tarkov. 
        i.e. Strength, Stamina, Restances, Toughness, etc. that level up when doing relevant activities and tasks.

        Get better at various things by doing them.




THIS README IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
