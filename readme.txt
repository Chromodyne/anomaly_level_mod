==============
=INSTALLATION=
==============

    1. Extract the gamedata folder in the archive to your Anomaly installation directory.
    2. Enjoy!

=========  
=GENERAL=
=========

NOTICE: This addon is in very early stages of development. Most planned features are not yet implemented.
        Please keep this in mind when using this addon.

This addon adds a leveling system to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly. Currently it is very rudimentary; however, I to make
it much more in-depth in the coming months.

In its current state, when the player kills NPCs or mutants in the Zone they gain experience points. After gaining a
certain amount of these points the player will level-up, increasing their stats. 

The exact details can be found in:

    \gamedata\configs\levelmod\level_system.ltx

================
= KNOWN ISSUES =
================

    1. Max carry weight gains will reset if you mess with the max weight slider in the difficulty options.
    2.


==================
=PLANNED FEATURES=
==================

    NOTICE: All planned features are subject to change or cancellation at my sole discretion. Timeframes given are 
    ROUGH estimates of when I hope to have these features added in some form. These estimates may be completely wrong.

    ============================
    =NEAR FUTURE (1 - 3 months)=
    ============================

    1. Experience points from kills are based on the relative difficulty of entity killed.
        e.g. A Chimera will grant much more experience than a Flesh.
    2. Difficulty based stat increases.
        e.g. Higher difficulty levels will reduce stat gains on level up.
    3. Experience point loss on death. (Optional)
    4. A placeholder UI for the mod.

    ===============================
    =FURTHER ALONG (6 - 12 months)=
    ===============================

    1. A sleek but functional UI for the mod.

    2. SKILL BASED EXPERIENCE SYSTEM

        This is the major milestone I will be moving towards.  A seperate experience pool for skills ala Tarkov. 
        i.e. Strength, Stamina, Restances, Toughness, etc. that level up when doing relevant activities and tasks.

        Get better at various things by doing them.
    
    ====================
    =DISTANT FUTURE n/a=
    ====================

    NOTE: These may not be viable. Don't hold your breath.

    1. Level system for NPC Stalkers.


THIS README IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
